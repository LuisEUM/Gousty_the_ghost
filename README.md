## Overview

In my first project during the web development bootcamp at Ironhack, I took on the challenge of creating a computer game. I used HTML5 and JavaScript to develop the game logic and manipulate objects on the canvas, complemented by CSS3 for the design and layout of the interface. GitHub served as the version control platform, while environment and character graphics were created using Adobe Illustrator. This project not only showcases my ability to combine front-end development with graphic design but also culminates in an interactive game that reflects my competence in integrating web technologies and design tools.

I deeply appreciate Pedro Salazar for his support in the final stage. Together, in just 3 weeks, we fulfilled a childhood dream by creating this video game while managing other work commitments. Effective task coordination and the ability to work as a team under pressure were crucial in meeting this challenge in such a short time, demonstrating our passion and commitment to the realization of innovative projects.
